# Unix Shell functions in C

In this project, I have implemented the basic unix shell commands from scratch in C. 

## Following commands are supported by the shell

* ls  
* grep 
* cat 
* Mv 
* Cp 
* Cd 
* Pwd 
* rm  
* Chmod 
* Mkdir 
* It can also run inbuilt binaries (like ps, pmap, wget, etc.) with arguments.
